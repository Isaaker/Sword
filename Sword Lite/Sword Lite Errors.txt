                                                                    Sword Lite Errors
Below you will find a list of errors that may occur in the program:
1.When using some IDE's you may encounter some bugs, you can try to use another IDE. Or look for the failure, the most normal is that the IDE is not updated, that there is some character that it does not understand or that when importing it the tabulation has changed.
2.In some cases when the program asks us something and we don't answer as expected, for example: "A. Exit, B. Continue ?" if in this case we answer "w" we would run into the error, I am thinking of using a loop to ask again but now the only thing that would do is to stop the program.
3.This is a very rare error but there is a possibility that it could happen, in case the program would enter in an infinite loop, (Example: "w w w w w w w w w w w") what you should do is to press the key: C and the key: Ctrl. at the same time. This error is very dangerous because it could end up consuming all the resources.

Below I leave at your disposal a list in which I tell you in which IDE and OS I have tested the program.
