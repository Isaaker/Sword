Sword

Hello, my name is Isaaker and this is my Sword software. This software is intended to generate passwords and PINs, sadly it is only available in Spanish. But in the future I will create a development branch to translate it to English, being something like "Phyton 1.3_ English.py" and "Phyton 1.3_Espa√±ol.py". For those who have doubts you can contact me at hernan.marti.isaac@gmail.com.
I also leave at your disposal the license that is very important to read it. And a user's manual that we will also have to translate.
Thank you very much.
